# Typo in vP=9.680 km/s where rho=9.256 and T=700K? Based on plot digitizer, should be 6.98 km/s. Also seems to be a typo in vP=7.790, where rho=9.742, T=700K. Should be closer to 7.700 based on plot digitizer. Definitely doesn't agree with plot. Uncertainty agrees.rho,drho,P,dP,vP,dvP,P medium,T8.88,0.01,14.4,0.8,6800,70,NaCl,3009.143,0.003,21.7,0.9,7150,70,NaCl,3009.653,0.005,38,1.8,7900,60,NaCl,30010.387,0.005,67.2,2.8,8780,80,Ne,30010.498,0.011,72.2,4.1,8910,110,Ne,30011.141,0.008,104.6,4.5,9420,60,NaCl,3008.611,0.003,11.1,1,6140,10,NaCl,7009.256,0.004,26.9,1.5,6980,40,NaCl,7009.446,0.001,32.4,1.7,7240,60,NaCl,7009.742,0.004,42.1,2.1,7700,70,NaCl,70010.304,0.004,67.1,2.6,8290,30,Ne,700
